This form uses inline CSS to style various elements:

The headings (h2) are styled with different colors using inline CSS (color property).
Labels for form fields are given unique colors to stand out (color property).
Form inputs (text, email, password) have defined widths, padding, and border styles for consistency (width, padding, border, border-radius).
The submit button has a background color, text color, padding, and border styling to make it visually appealing and consistent with the form's theme.
You can further customize the colors, styles, and layout according to your preferences by adjusting the CSS properties within the inline styles.
